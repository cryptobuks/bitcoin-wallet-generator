      <h3>Create a Bitcoin Brain Wallet</h3>
      <h5>Your Brain Wallet has been generated with the input: "{{brainSrc}}"</h5>
      <h6>Address: {{address}}</h6>
      <h6>Private Key: {{privateKey}}</h6>

      <p>This passphrase, depending upon the type of generator you are using, is hashed with SHA-256 or the Scrypt algorithm to generate a Bitcoin private key and then a Bitcoin public key.</p>
      <p>The hash of these passphrases is computationally impossible to reverse. That’s why if you have chosen a hard to guess passphrase, it will be impossible for an attacker to steal your funds. See our guide on “What is a Bitcoin Hash?“</p>
      <p>So whenever you put a passphrase in the brain wallet generator, it will hash it using algorithms such as SHA-256 or Scrypt and provide you with a Bitcoin private key/Bitcoin public key pair.</p>
      <p>Now, once you have the public/private addresses, you can store your funds on them anytime without worrying. This is because now your private keys will only be generated through the “brain wallet” (which is in your head).</p>
      <p>Note: Don’t use passphrases or brain wallets generated by humans as they are predictable.</p>
